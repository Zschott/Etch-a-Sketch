# Etch-a-Sketch

This project was my first real step at combinging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Like many of my projects completed at this time for the Odin Project, this serves mostly as a proof of concept. I'd truly like to spend more time cleaning this project up, but unfortunately must move on in order to focus on learning new concepts.

If I get the chance to revisit this in the future, I'd really like to implement a color randomizer for the blocks, as well as creating a means to introduce some sort of keyboard support that utilizes W,A,S,D to move around.
